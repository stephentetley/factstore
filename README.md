# factstore

Output Flix relations (facts) to SQLite.

Factstore is intended to be a complementary project to Factio which deals
with reading SQLite facts (and Csv and flat file facts). It may be merged
at some point, but currently the design space for writing to SQLite seems
too large for it to comfortably fit with Factio.
